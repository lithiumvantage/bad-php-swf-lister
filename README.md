# bad-php-swf-lister
Just a quick script I whipped to list and play Adobe Flash (swf) files in php webserver. It works.

What you see is what you get. I wrote this so long ago and just kept adding onto it over the years.

Funny how I've picked up so many methods to write PHP stuff since 07, but old habits die hard.
